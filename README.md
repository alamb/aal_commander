This is a personal project that implements a simple command line interface w/ autocomplete, in C++

I hacked on it to get more experience with CMake, vscode, and making an interface w/ autocomplete. It is in C++ b/c that is what I know well

Features:
  Tests
  Autocomplete via the linenoise library

To build:

```
mkdir build
( cd build && cmake ..)
make
```

To run:
```
cd build
./aal
```
